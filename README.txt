This is a setup script I made to automate the setup of a mobile, ssh-accesssable, through pi-hosted wifi, kali on a raspberry Pi. It will setup the raspberry pi to broadcast a network that will be accesssable through ssh. 
The network name by default is "Skynet" and the password is "password" I have marked in the script where thouse can be changed, and I recommend doing so.
Once you connect, it will be accessable on 192.168.5.1 and if you connect another wifi usb or ethernet it will pass through the internet connection to your connected device.
If you have any improvements please let me know and I will do my best to add them.
